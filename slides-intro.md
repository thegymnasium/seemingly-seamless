## 👋 We’re Gymnasium

![Gymnasium homepage, June 2025.](img/gym-homepage-06-2025-1920w.png)

Note:

Bonjour, Ahoj, Hello — we're Gymnasium — Aquent’s free learning platform.

Together, we built Gymnasium — it’s marketing site and Open edX learner experience.

## About Gymnasium

We offer free online courses and tutorials on design, development, UX, prototyping, accessibility, and career skills. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Since 2013, we’ve welcomed over 160,000 students from more than 200 countries and regions, and over 20,000 of them have earned credentials. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

For many students, these credentials — certificates and badges — significantly increase their chances of landing a job. <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## New Skills

Note:

Our students frequently share their achievements on LinkedIn, showcasing the skills they’ve built through Gymnasium.

## Empowerment

Note:

New skills often lead to empowerment. Seeing an intern like Salma in Egypt upskilling is just one of over 20,000 stories that make free online learning meaningful — thanks to Gymnasium and made possible by our parent company, Aquent. Congrats to Salma!

Enough about us, let’s talk about Open edX.

## Roots to Redwood

- **2013:** Gymnasium launches on a custom-built platform with one, then two courses <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- **2015:** Gymnasium relaunches on Open edX (featured in Open edX Conference talk) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- **2018:** Migration to Hawthorn; no pop quizzes, just exceptional performance <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- **2024**: Migration from Hawthorn to Redwood; 10 years in 10 hours <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- **2025:** 🔮 🎱 🥠 Twists, turns, and a big reveal… *Stick around.* 🙏 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:

What started as a custom-built platform grew into something much bigger and better, thanks to Open edX. This brief timeline highlights the key migrations and milestones that shaped Gymnasium — and shaped my approach to design and development along the way.
