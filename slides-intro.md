## Why Are We Here?

- We will take you through our history with the platform, and show you where we ended up.
- Along the way, we ran into many pitfalls, least of which was our desire for maximum customization.
- We're here to show our version of seamless, which resulted in **zero** support tickets filed post new platform launch.
