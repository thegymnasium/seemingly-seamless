## Why Are We Here?

- We’re here to talk about customizing Open edX.
- We will take you through our history with the platform, and show you where we ended up.
- Along the way, we ran into many pitfalls, least of which was our desire for maximum customization.
- We're here to show our version of seamless, which resulted in **zero** support tickets filed post new platform launch.

Notes: (Justin)
New skills often lead to empowerment. Seeing an intern like Salma in Egypt upskilling is just one of over 20,000 stories that make free online learning meaningful — thanks to Gymnasium and made possible by our parent company, Aquent. Congrats to Salma!
