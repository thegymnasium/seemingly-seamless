## Pre-upgrade recap

------

### theme customized<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

theme was heavily customized

Notes:
- Gymnasiumâ€™s Hawthorn based theme was very customized
- Used a SSG (Jekyll) to include pre-generated HTML fragments within the LMS
- Our marketing site and LMS were effectively one and the same.

### pages = extra steps<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

new pages = extra steps

Notes:

- we **needed** our hosting provider to generate new pages

------

### upgrade = challenge<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

upgrading code became a challenge

Notes:
- "Stuck" on Hawthorn since 2020
- We were hampered by the limitations of Open edX. [REVISE]
- [revise] do we use a word other than upgrade/migration to encompass both?
