### theme customized<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

theme was heavily customized

Notes:
- Gymnasiumâ€™s Hawthorn based comprehensive theme was very customized
- Used a SSG (Jekyll) to include pre-generated HTML fragments within the theme
- Our marketing site and LMS were effectively one and the same.

### pages = extra steps<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

new pages = extra steps

Notes:
- we **needed** our hosting provider to generate new pages
- slow release process

### upgrade = challenge<!-- .element: class="hide" -->

upgrading code became a challenge

Notes:
