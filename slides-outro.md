## Next Steps?

Revisit our implentation by:

- using (the visual parts of) the Paragon design system<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- contributing code improvements to the MFEs<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- testing our customizations with the next versions of open edx<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- creating additional MFEs to account for parts of the UI we decided to hide<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

## Post Sh*t <!-- .element: class="hide" -->

Despite hardships, we’re able to see our mission through by now turning all of our content public.

And that was something our parent company didn’t have to do.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Notes:

- But it flew... nay, it soared and it was seamless.

## Emergency Landing

The end of Gymnasium: in a moment of crisis, design & development was incredibly easy for us.

Shut down LMS rapidly and rerouted.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

We made an incredibly flexible, agile environment - scaling up & scaling down/back<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Notes:
[optional]: say something about "graceful degradation"
