## Plot Twist
All things will eventually come to pass.

free costs money… it is bittersweet in a way… but we’re able to see our mission through by now turning all of this content public… and that was something Aquent didn’t have to do…

Example note.

## Plot twist. Oops!

- We built the plane, but we had to land it and retire it to the Great American Airplane Graveyard. (image?)

- Didn't spend more than a few months flying our new jet.


Notes:
For the developers among you, we leaned into "graceful degradation" to shut down the LMS

---

## Post Gymnasium

- core team members stuck on after layoffs to help transition the site to open-sourced content


---

## Building the sinking ship

The end of Gymnasium: in a moment of crisis, design & development was incredibly easy for us. Shut down LMS rapidly and rerouted.

We made an incredibly flexible, agile environment - scaling up & scaling down/back

Notes:
More details.

## Accomplished our Goals

- We accomplished our goals and our mission continues. Aquent’s mission to provide free education continues, sans certificates.
