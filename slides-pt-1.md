> Good design and good markup provide structure to content. Good markup is a fundamental part of good design: beautiful on the inside, beautiful on the outside.

## Choosing Tools That Are Seamless

- We migrated our static site generator from Jekyll to Eleventy (11ty)
- We chose Eleventy because it put content and design before development
- We chose a front-end tool that was accessible and extensible

- The original design and development philosophy still guides our work nearly a decade later.
- Open edX—and our approach—has matured over time.
- My philosophy centers on the learner, with design leading development.
- We build with a content-first mindset and human-readable structure.
- I advocate for using core web technologies over frameworks by default.

Note:
Almost 10 years later, that design and development philosophy persisted, in some ways becoming ubiquitous to how we, and I, work.

Open edX has matured, and so have we.

My design and development philosophy is centered around the student, the learner, if you will. With visual and experience design coming before development. Designing a better learner experience is intentional, yes, but it’s also a natural byproduct of the way we build.

That way of building combines a content-first mindset with human-readable data and structure, for people, for robots, and for the tools we rely on.

It means championing core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, not frameworks by default. Frameworks have their place, but the foundation should be written in plain, readable code. Not markup soup.
