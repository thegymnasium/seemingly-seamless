## Pre-upgrade recap

upgrading code became a challenge

Notes:
- "Stuck" on Hawthorn since 2020

    - show comparison of original nav vs new
    - show code samples - yaml to json
    - introduce header states (currrent page state, etc)
  - footer
    - design/development worked together
      - hawthorn footer
      - new footer
    - "dumb" footer - no states to the buttons
