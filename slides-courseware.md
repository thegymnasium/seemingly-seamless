Notes:

#### Hawthorn course navigation

------

#### Hawthorn syllabus

![Example of separate syllabus page](img/v3-courseware-syllabus.png)

Notes:
- this syllabus is actually an "overloaded" updates section - one of the many hacks we did (this is before you could add a custom page)

---

### All in for MFEs

Notes:
- open edx already had all the features we needed in MFEs
- remove features using the comprehensive theme (aka, the old LMS theme), ie disabled bookmarks
